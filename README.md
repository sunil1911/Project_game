# Project_game
This Python program creates a Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) game using Pygame. It draws a 3×3 grid, lets players place X or O with mouse clicks, checks for winners or draws, and displays results. Players can press R to restart. The game continuously updates the board and handles all events smoothly.
